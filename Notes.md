**Java** has the following characteristics :

- It is easy to use and portable: Memory management with pointers is not permitted.
- It is not dependent on the host platform.
- It is Secure and Dynamic: It is designed to securely run code from distant sources.
- It has language support as well as networking libraries.
- It is Robust: Java has its own powerful memory management system. This helps to eliminate errors by checking the code during compilation and execution.
- Java is Multithreaded: it supports numerous thread executions (i.e., lightweight processes), as well as a set of synchronization primitives.

**Java** is a widely used programming language for embedded system development, backend systems, and APIs. It's referred to as an object-oriented programming language. Some of Java's core concepts include **Recursion** and **Parallelism**.
